        I work with a number of public and private sector clients - ranging from
        stealth start-ups to large government bodies. My work is varied and adjusts
        to the particular needs of a client. Here are some of the ways I have worked:
    </p>

    <div class="client">
        <h4>
            Redgate Software Ltd. - Growing an established technical product by 200%
            <br>
            <span class="sub">2015-2016</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Over the course of twelve months, I created a two year road map for an established product
            and coached a new technical team on relevant domain insights. I did this by:
        </p>
        <ul>
           <li>Analysing in detail all competitors, including their strengths, weaknesses, market share and brand strength</li>
           <li>Segmenting the user base, discovering divergence in the value propositions were served</li>
           <li>Identifying the best value proposition to follow using market gap analysis</li>
           <li>Championing a repositioning allowing for focused marketing and development activities</li>
           <li>Optimising development schedules for quality and velocity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These activities increased revenue by 200% in two years, reverting a trend of 30% year-on-year decline.
        </p>

        <h4>
            The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy - Agile prototyping in the public sector
            <br>
            <span class="sub">2016-2017</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Combining User Experience, Product Management and Development skills, I rapidly specified and developed
            prototypes for internal and external testing. Key activities included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interviewing senior stakeholders, negotiating scope and championing iterative delivery</li>
            <li>Maximising insights from prototypes by creating backlogs that included both well understood and less well understood aspects</li>
            <li>Rapid end-to-end prototype development (2-3 projects per week) as a one-person team</li>
            <li>Same-day iteration of road map, design, and code, based on user test feedback</li>
            <li>Adhering to government practices and prefered programming languages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This enabled testing future digital services at an unprecedented rate.

    <div class="client">
        <h4>
            A privately held start-up in recruitment - 100% business alignment for multiple remote teams
            <br>
            <span class="sub">2017</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
            This growing company needed a technical product owner to ensure that
            development activities were focused on business requirements. I closed the loop by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Introducing agile methodologies to adjust to fast-changing business requirements</li>
            <li>Managing three high-velocity remote development teams, facilitating their collaboration</li>
            <li>Scoping open-ended business requirements to technical specifications</li>
            <li>Identifying missing skills in the technical team to guide recruitment</li>
            <li>Designing interactions, work-flows, and UI components</li>
            <li>Fostering appreciation for technical challenges and non-functional requirements among senior stakeholders</li>
            <li>Providing early technical input to sales conversations</li>
            <li>Implementing continuous delivery</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Development time spent on current business priorities went from an initial 10% to 90% within three months,
            with the remaining 10% understood by senior stakeholders to be crucial maintenance an non-functional work.

        <h4>
            A stealth start-up in music technology - A road map for monetising disruptive technology
            <br>
            <span class="sub">2016</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
            A seed-funded start-up with disruptive technology needed a path to revenue.
            In a brief engagement, I advised them based on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing an intimate understanding of the complex music industry</li>
            <li>Analysing the competitors in the field, weighing technological, commercial, and strategic aspects</li>
            <li>Discussing which business models align with the directors' interests and strengths</li>
            <li>Extensively analysing market behaviours</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Despite limited funds, we built a road map identifying multiple quick paths to revenue streams,
            and subsequent expansion options. The road map was branched on key decision points.
            This meant that even in their high-volatility business stage,
            my client had access to the best strategy in any possible circumstance.
